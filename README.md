# Chess
a game of chess programmed in Python with Pygame library. <br>
<h2>Game features</h2>
Game is fully resizable, has fully working special moves(pawn promotion, en passant, castling), has a settings window with settings for special moves and timer
and checkmate mechanic<br>
*Note: to apply changes in size, you must press the r button to reset the game <br>
**Note: size of the window only depends on the width, so the game always keeps the same ratio, however this means the game is not good for fullscreen, unless you screen is 48 * 60. <br>
***Note: if someone can take enemies king, it is a real way to win, there are certain problems with my code that prevent me from fixing these edge scenarios, so keep that in mind when playing. <br>
